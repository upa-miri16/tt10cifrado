## How it works

The project works through a Caesar Cipher to protect digital data in electronic devices. It uses the logic gates AND, OR and XOR to perform its functions, working with literal values that are transformed into numbers with the ASCII code, using two entries (A and B) that the code processes as binary coded numbers. Firstly, the code performs an addition so the user can choose the number of positions in the alphabet the text will be moved. After that, the code uses an ASCII code transformation to turn the literal values into numbers. Then, the numeric value is converted into its binary code form. Finally, a XOR function is performed with each number in the binary code for the two values (A = binary code per letter and B = binary code for Caesar Cipher). As these values are added, letters can be transferred and information will be ciphered.
