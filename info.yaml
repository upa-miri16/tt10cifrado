  # Inputs
  ui[0]: "INPUT_A0_B0" # Receives A0 and B0 as 1 character. It is given by the user.
  ui[1]: "INPUT_A1_B1" # Receives A1 and B1 as 1 character. It is given by the user.
  ui[2]: "INPUT_A2_B2" # Receives A2 and B2 as 1 character. It is given by the user.
  ui[3]: "INPUT_A3_B3" # Receives A3 and B3 as 1 character. It is given by the user.
  ui[4]: "INPUT_A4_B4" # Receives A4 and B4 as 1 character. It is given by the user.
  ui[5]: "INPUT_A5_B5" # Receives A5 and B0 as 1 character. It is given by the user.

  # Outputs
  # WHERE:
  # Each pin processes a number of the binary code, 1 for A and 1 for B
  # A = The ASCII code of the letter in binary code
  # B = The number of places for displacement in Caesar Cipher represented in binary code.
